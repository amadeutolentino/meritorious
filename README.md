Meritorious
===========

This is a behavior tracking application for school teachers to use.

In many schools, the concept of `merit` and `demerit` is used to track students'
behavior. This application will allow a teacher to update these records in real
time from a web interface.

Guidelines
----------

Use the following guides for getting things done, programming well, and
programming in style.

* [Protocol](http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/protocol)
* [Best Practices](http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/best-practices)
* [Style](http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/style)

This project is also a foray and experiment into DCI. The
[Schizo](https://github.com/cjbottaro/schizo) gem is used to dynamically mixin
behavior to objects at runtime. This style will be used throughout the codebase.
